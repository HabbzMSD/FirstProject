                                                    ** PROBLEM OBJECTIVE **
An interactive chatbot with a sassy personality who seems interested on the user
Asks the users name and allows input, then greets mentioning the name and makes a joke of it
Tells the user the amount of characters on his/her name
Asks the users age and allows input, then calculates how old the user will be in 10 years time
Thanks the user for using the program and apologises for wasting 5 second of their lives.





                                                      ** CODE BREAKDOWN ** 
A very basic program to test myself and my beginners knowledge of the Python3 syntax
The problem consists mainly of PRINT statements, some input functions and some concatenations.
Includes a ASCII image
